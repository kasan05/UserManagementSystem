# UserManagementSystem
Role based user management system using spring security
Used Technologies
Spring mvc
hibernate
jquery
bootstrap

This system acts differently to different users.admin see all contents.meanwhile other users cant see those.Access is given by role.
I have uploaded a sql dump file.import that file to data base there is two users (admin and a normal user).admin can view the userlist.
and other user cannot access it.The important thing that i focused here is the secrity stuff.not the crud opertaions
